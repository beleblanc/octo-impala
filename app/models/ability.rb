    #
     user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
     if user.has_role? :admin
       can :access, :rails_admin
       can :manage, :all
       can :dashboard              # grant access to the dashboard
     elsif user.has_role? :super_admin
       can :access, :rails_admin
       can :manage, :all
       can :dashboard
     elsif user.has_role? :prosecutor
       can :manage, CaseDetail, :user_id => user.id
     end

    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions here are
    # :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on. If you pass
    # :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
